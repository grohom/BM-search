# Project Search Engine

A fast, client-side search engine for 200,000+ projects with autocomplete functionality.

## Features

- **Fast Autocomplete**: Real-time word suggestions as you type (200ms debounce)
- **Prefix Matching**: Searches match word prefixes, case-insensitive
- **Multi-word Search**: Search for multiple words; results must contain all words
- **Paginated Results**: 50 results per page with smooth pagination
- **Pure Client-Side**: No server required, runs entirely in the browser
- **Binary Search**: Efficient O(log n) search algorithm

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Export Your Data (Python)

Run these commands in Python to export your preprocessed data:

```python
import json

# Export sorted words
words = sorted(word_dict.keys(), key=str.lower)
with open('words.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(words, f)

# Export word index
word_index = {word: sorted(list(indices)) for word, indices in word_dict.items()}
with open('word_index.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(word_index, f)

# Export projects
with open('projects.txt', 'r') as f:
    projects = [line.strip() for line in f]
with open('projects.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(projects, f)
```

### 2. File Structure

Place all files in your repository:

```
your-repo/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── search.js
├── words.json          (generated by Python)
├── word_index.json     (generated by Python)
└── projects.json       (generated by Python)
```

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push all files to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Select branch (usually `main`) and root folder
4. Save and wait for deployment

Your search engine will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo/`

## How It Works

### Data Files

- **words.json** (~500KB-1MB): Sorted array of unique words for autocomplete
- **word_index.json** (~2-4MB): Maps each word to project indices
- **projects.json** (~10MB): Complete list of project names

### Search Algorithm

1. User types a query (e.g., "machine learn")
2. Each word is split and processed independently
3. Binary search finds all dictionary words matching each prefix
4. For each matching word, we get the set of project indices
5. Results are the intersection of all project sets (AND logic)
6. Results are sorted by index and paginated

### Autocomplete

- Triggers after 200ms of no typing
- Shows up to 20 suggestions for the current word
- Uses binary search to find matches efficiently
- Keyboard navigation with ↑/↓ arrows
- Press Enter to select or search

## Performance

- **Data Load**: ~2-5 seconds (one-time, cached by browser)
- **Autocomplete**: <10ms typically
- **Search**: <100ms for most queries
- **Memory**: ~15-20MB total

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Customization

### Results Per Page
Change `resultsPerPage` in `search.js`:
```javascript
const resultsPerPage = 50; // Change to 25, 100, etc.
```

### Autocomplete Delay
Change debounce timeout in `search.js`:
```javascript
autocompleteTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    showAutocomplete(e.target.value);
}, 200); // Change to 100, 300, etc.
```

### Max Autocomplete Results
Change in `showAutocomplete()` function:
```javascript
const matches = getMatchingWords(lastWord, 20); // Change to 10, 30, etc.
```

### Colors
Edit `styles.css` to change the gradient and accent colors:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```
